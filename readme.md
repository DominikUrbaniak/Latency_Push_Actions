# Latency Impact on Robotic Push Actions for Edge Computing Scenarios

Implementation of linear push actions with UR5e, Robotiq 2F-85 gripper and custom cube using ROS2 Humble and Gazebo 11.10.2

## External Packages 
(to be included into the workspace along the packages from this repository)
- ROS2 UR description package (ur_description): https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description
- IOC-UPC inverse kinematics library for UR robots (kinenik): https://gitioc.upc.edu/robots/kinenik

## Packages in this repository
- main_pkg: setup of the gazebo environment with robot, gripper and cubes, and velocity controller, using modified launch file from https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Gazebo_Simulation, and modified multi-object launch mechanism by TheConstruct: https://bitbucket.org/theconstructcore/box_bot/src/foxy/box_bot_description/launch/
- experiments: Two experiments for pushing a cube in a straight line or to change its rotation
- custom_interfaces: Includes the custom messages and services
- robotiq_2f_model: model from https://github.com/beta-robots/robotiq/tree/master/robotiq_2f_model wrapped in ROS2 package

## Run experiments
*ros2 launch main_pkg main.launch.py*

Choose one experiment and execute following commands in a second terminal:

1st experiment: 
- *ros2 run experiments push_translation_gazebo 0.08*
- *ros2 run experiments push_translation_main 0.08 private5g 0.0006 60 125 0*

2nd experiment: 
- *ros2 run experiments push_edge_gazebo* 0.1*
- *ros2 run experiments push_edge_main* 0.1 wifi5_loaded 0.0001 3 170*
