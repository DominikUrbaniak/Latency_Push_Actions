# Latency Impact on Robotic Push Actions for Edge Computing Scenarios

Implementation of linear push actions with UR5e, Robotiq 2F-85 gripper and custom cube using ROS2 Humble and Gazebo 11.10.2

## External Packages (to be copied into the workspace along the packages from this repository)
- ROS2 UR description package (ur_description): https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description
- IOC-UPC inverse kinematics library for UR robots (kinenik): https://gitioc.upc.edu/robots/kinenik

## Packages in this repository
- pkg_main: setup of the gazebo environment with robot, gripper and cubes, and velocity controller
- pkg_experiments: Two experiments for pushing a cube in a straight line or to change its rotation

## Remarks
- Latency distributions of communication technologies are generated by AAU, Denmark, and cannot be shared here.
